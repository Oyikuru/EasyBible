Easy Bible version 1.01.2025
Python 3.12
I did not document or comment on everything because most of the functions and the variable names
describes the code well enough to understand.

This program, I wrote it with the intention to learn as taking the opportunity to spread
the bible by providing a platform for studying it.

Most of my intentions were not met due to the limitations of my knowledge in programming
especially in the collection section of the program. I wanted a text editor that could be 
used easily without difficuly. The purpose is to avoid moving out of the program to look for another apps
to write study notes. I also wated the text editor to have the ability to convert or save the text as wordocument
and pdf or even html. all these things i failed to achieve.
What i have now can basicly do some little formating playing around with tags.
The user experince is deffinately not okay. Me as the prgrammer can use the text editor very well and get what i want but
a user who knows nothing abou how the text editor was programmed will achieve nothing.

The notes taken by the user on verses are saved in an sqlite database which the user can extract all in text formart.
this is already implemented. The format of the text file is in a way that it will be easy to create with it another database table
in the orinal structure. The intention was to make a file out of the notes that can be shared so that those with this
application will be able to open it and read it verse by verse just like the how the notes are read now
that if a user select a verse by placing the cursor on it, he can read the notes on that verse by clicking on the read note icon
or from the context menu or from the menu bar in tools

The reason why I am explaining all this is to get someone who can help me achieve my childhood dream
of making a powerful bible program. I have to teach my self programming for this dream and this is what i can achieve
so far. I am a self taught programmer that is also some of the reasons why my knowledge in programming is so much limited as
most of the things i get from tutorials or stackoverflow. I need to see how someone experienced and knowledgable approaches
and whites a whole application like this.

Anyone who is willing can improve the program and make it better without changing my intentions of the app.
You can change how the interface look and the generall accessbility without taking out an exixting feature.
You can add any feature as long as it will make studying the bible easy.
You can add other bible versions
Identify bugs and fix.
Improve eixisting codes and functions.
NOTE: PLEASE, WHERE POSIBLE COMMENT YOUR CODE WELL AND GENERALLY MAKE IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

For this program, i used tkinter, ttkbootstap for the gui, python 3.12
You can use any other gui python library you are flexible as long as you will be able to achieve the same thing as my intention
If you feel like rewriting the program in another language, C++, C#, C or Java can do. But you will have to let me know why first.

This application is meant to be free and open source. Please when you improve this program, make it available for free
and make the source code availble at community platforms.
When you improve the program, let me know as well so that i can read and also improve my skills.
If you feel like giving me a credit for this, please feel free. I will appreciate is so much.



This is software by the Heavenly City Community. Heavenly city community is a christian community or groups of people
living in a christian lifestyle. As the leader, I have always dreamed of this application to surport us in our
bible studies. You can surport us by improving it.
